## Overview

This was a project built for a small start up business looking for a possible design for their one product store selling a CryptoCurrency Course. This was first prototyped in AdobeXD before being created in React.

## Technologies
Project Utilised: 
* ReactJS
* HTML
* CSS
* JS
* Adobe Photoshop
* Adobe XD

## Process
* Basic wireframes were drawn and shown to the owner to get a general idea of what they wanted, these were of a low fidelity.
* High fidelity prototypes were then drawn up with AdobeXD as documented below

* This was then recreated in React using React-Styled-Components to design different part of the application.


## Takeaway Points
While this was the first attempt at focusing soley on creating a site in HTML and CSS based off of a prototype, this taught me a couple of valuable lessons within the process. A key takeaway point from this project was ensuring I think about mobile design first. This is because this is the resolution with the least real estate and it is much easier to scale larger than scale down.
